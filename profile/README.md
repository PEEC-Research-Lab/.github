## WELCOME
Welcome to the Power Electronics and Energy Control (PEEC) Lab! PEEC is directed by Dr. Xiaofan Cui, Assistant Professor of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Samueli School of Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, and empowered by our students, researchers, and all our sponsors. At our lab, we work on the theory and hardware that transform power-electronics-based energy systems, from those as small as power conversion circuits to those as large as interconnected microgrids, from those as fast as electromagnetic transients to those as slow as electrochemical dynamics. Fostered by power electronics' high controllability, speed, and power density, energy systems can be more heterogeneous in form, agile in actuation, hierarchical in scale, and more distributed in function. Our ultimate research goal is to bridge the fundamental theory and emerging applications of power-electronics-dominated energy systems by innovating control-aware modeling frameworks, provably-correct control policies, physics-informed learning schemes, and high-performance hardware validations. 
## Our Focus:
High-speed, high-frequency power conversion  for information & data systems
Power management of heterogeneous battery energy storage systems
Nonlinear control and stability of microgrids
Power-electronics-enabled distributed energy generation and integration
